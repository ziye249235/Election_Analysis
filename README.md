# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to find out the results of the total votes of each candidate as well as their vote %. The same exercise was done again for each county. by doing this, we were able to determine the winning candidates and the winning county.

Here are the results of the election audit:
* 369,711 votes were cast in the election

## Election-Audit Summary
I propose that this script can be used with modifications for any elections to come in order to facilitate the tallying of votes. Here are some examples on how this script canbe modified for other elections:
* The script will adjust itself to tally all counties and candidates, no matter how many of them there are
* The script can be modified to calculate the number of votes for each candidate per county 
* The script can be modified to calculate the winning candidate for each county
